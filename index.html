<!-- I will explain all the code on this notepad here, but there are a few different types of coding in some other pages that i
need to explain, the other pages won't have explanations because i'd just be repeating myself
-questions.html has explanations about the radio buttons and the submit
-style.css explains the different styles i used
All the other webpages has the same coding used in different ways, so just refer to assignment.html to
get all explanations (which is here) Thank you.  -->

  <h1> -Biography- </h1>

<p>I am an Australian artist that creates EDM music. I also have a youtube channel that is
   almost purely my music and Geometry dash. <br>
  This website basically promotes all the virtual stuff I do in my spare time. I have also
  created a link to Isurcraft, a fellow friend of mine who enjoys the same aspects of gaming
  that I enjoy.

<h2> Upcoming </h2>

<p> I am intending to make more youtube videos in the future (I haven't been able to upload for ages.) <br>
  But I need a new screen recorder... or a new computer, which is not possible for me right now... so Geometry dash might have to wait.
  On the music front, I got several more songs coming out and I can't wait to release them!! :D </p>
